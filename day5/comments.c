/*   Code & Readability:

Code readability means how easy it is for someone else (or future you!) to read, understand, and follow your code.

Readable code:

Explains what it does clearly

Is clean, consistent, and well-organized

Is easier to debug, maintain, and extend

Why readability matters:

Makes teamwork easier (others can quickly understand your code)

Helps you later (you’ll understand your own code months later!)

Reduces bugs

Makes it easier to add new features or fix problems

Tips to write readable code (use today!)
